# Digital Design Lab Deliverables Repository

Welcome to the **Digital Design Lab Submissions Repository**.  
This repository will serve as the **submission portal for all lab deliverables** throughout the week. Students are required to follow the given structure and guidelines strictly while submitting their work.

## AI Assistance Acknowledgment
I have used AI and youtube assistance in the following aspects of this project:
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive README.md files for better project organization and understanding
- **Algorithm Understanding**: Understanding what I am asked to design and then learning the concpet about design
- **Debugging Support**: Assistance in debugging code when I was unable to resolve issues independently

## Lab Manual Outline

The course is structured around a progressive lab manual that introduces **SystemVerilog-based Digital Design** concepts and FPGA synthesis methodology. The labs (the lab manual is attached [here]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXFfLt3pLThsZbMhK5p9150xLZNFo4R9T_oMhC6NobY/edit?usp=sharing))) are divided into **combinational, sequential, FSM, interface, and integration-based designs**.
